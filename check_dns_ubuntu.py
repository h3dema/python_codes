    """Checks if Bind DNS server is running on a host via SSH.

    This function attempts to connect to the specified host via SSH using either certificate-based authentication.  
    It then checks the status of the Bind DNS service using systemd (for modern Ubuntu systems) and falls back
    to SysV init scripts for older systems.

    Args:
        host_info (tuple or list): A tuple or list containing the hostname/IP and port.
                                    e.g., ("example.com", 22) or ["192.168.1.100", 2222]
        username (str, optional): The username for SSH authentication. Defaults to "root".
        certificate_path (str): The path to the SSH certificate file.
            If provided, certificate authentication will be used.  If None, password
            authentication will be attempted (less secure).  Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        str: A string indicating the status of the Bind DNS server on the host.
            Possible return values include:
            - "{host_info}: Bind DNS is running"
            - "{host_info}: Bind DNS is running (SysV init)"  (for older systems)
            - "{host_info}: Bind DNS is NOT running (or not found)"
            - "{host_info}: Authentication failed (certificate)"
            - "{host_info}: Connection error: {error_message}"
            - "{host_info}: SSH error: {error_message}"
            - "{host_info}: Certificate path is required" (if no certificate path is given)
            - "{host_info}: Error: {error_message}" (for other errors)
